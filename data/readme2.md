Using publicly available crisis severity and funding data, create a map showing mismatches between humanitarian needs and Pooled Fund coverage. Use project-level data (budgets, cluster, population indicators) to flag unusually high or low beneficiary-to-budget ratios and suggest comparable projects for benchmarking.


    1. Create a map showing mismatches

    2. Flag unusually high/low budget ratios

    3. Suggest comparable projects for benchmarking
